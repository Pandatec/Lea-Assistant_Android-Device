Device Android app, just receiving / sending audio from server. Substitute for the ESP32 hardware-base device.

To publish a new release running on the development server, push a tage with the following format: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
If you want this release to be shipped to the public (running on the production server), the tag should have this format instead: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>r`.
